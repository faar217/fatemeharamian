        <p>This paper reviews the academic literature on speed bumps. This evidence shows that implementing a speed bump benefits the exchange instituting it - enhancing competition at the top of its order book and reducing its quoted and effective spreads. However, the impact of speed bumps on overall market quality is less clear and remains a subject of debate.</p>

        <p>This paper examines end-of-day trading mechanisms in European equity markets. It shows that closing mechanisms account for around 18% of consolidated Euro volume in STOXX 600 stocks from January 2021 to September 2022. Alternative trading mechanisms that have emerged to compete with the primary market auctions only capture around 16% of this activity. The paper also explores the determinants of the exchange and alternative closing mechanism volumes. It also discusses the reasons behind the limited adoption of alternative closing mechanisms despite offering lower trading fees. These include differing perspectives of market participants about the potential impact of fragmentation at the close, the ability to capture the benefits of lower fees, and differences in the market structure of the mechanisms.</p>

        <p>European market operators offer diverse retail trading mechanisms: retail-specific and all-to-all trading mechanisms that allow the interaction of all trader types. This paper examines retail-specific trading mechanisms available in European equity markets. It documents the features of these trading mechanisms and the level of activity over the period from January 2019 to July 2022. It also draws on the existing academic literature to gain insights into the mechanisms likely to lead to the best outcomes for retail investors. The paper also recommends that policy makers can improve retail execution quality by requiring additional transparency around retail trades and implementing a consolidated tape.</p>
